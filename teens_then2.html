<h1>Education/Reading facility</h1>
<p>The early 2000s saw the gradual beginning of a shift in educational technology, where the use of computers gradually started to emerge in schools and classrooms. Educational software, online resources, and early forms of digital learning platforms started to become available. Traditional textbooks and libraries remained the primary source for educational materials. A majority of tests also began to rise in the early 2000s, wherein high-stake exams started to mark their presence in education. The shift towards accountability measures had various positive and negative consequences, such as increased pressure on students and teachers with the promotion of data-driven decision-making.Reading facilities, like libraries and bookstores, continued to play an important part in the teenagers' life in 2000s. While the internet introduced more channels for reading and information, traditional libraries remained the nucleus of research, study, and leisure. Public libraries expanded services, such as computer access, educational programs, and community events, but with the rise in e-books and online reading platforms, the traditional role of libraries has slowly been eroded due to the gradual shift in the ways teenagers access and consume literature.</p>

<h1> New vs Old</h1>
<p>The 2000s were a very significant period in the lives of teenagers because, for the first time, the dawn of digital technologies began to reshape the way in which youths pass through their teenage years and interact with others. While the generation was still quite firmly rooted in more traditional social structures, it was the first to observe the changing face of the internet and early social media platforms. By the early 2000s, access to dial-up internet became widespread, with increased access to information and means of communication. Instant messaging, online forums, and even simpler social networking sites like MySpace and Friendster began to redefine social interaction: they provided new ways of communicating with peers and indulging in interests. Music and entertainment also took a radical shift in the 2000s. The introduction of the iPod in 2001 changed how teenagers listened to music because it became even more portable, with access to thousands of songs at any one time. MTV was still highly influential to pop culture, with reality shows and videos pioneering the airways. Online gaming came on strong in the 2000s as well in the form of Xbox and PlayStation for teens.While such technologies were developed, large portions of the life of a teenager did not change from generation to generation: school, part-time jobs, and activities after school. However, challenges and opportunities changed with the digital age, including cyberbullying, online safety, and pressures toward an idealized virtual presence. In that vein, access to educational resources, global communities, and avenues of self-expression are afforded through the internet.</p>
