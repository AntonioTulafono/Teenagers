<h1>The Impact of Social Media on Mental Health</h1>
<p>TEENAGERS NOW: Navigating Mental Health in the Digital Age
 Today's teenagers live in a world of digitization where social media networking sites form a huge part of their daily life. Continuous pressures of creating a perfect virtual image, cyberbullying, and unrepresentative models of beauty may be very harmful to their self-esteem and mental well-being. Furthermore, excessive screen time perturbs the sleeping patterns and thus causes further problems, including fatigue, distraction, and heightened anxiety and depression. FOMO and comparison with the curated lives of others foster feelings of inadequacy and isolation. Misinformation and harassment are added to those factors and further increase stress and anxiety
TEENAGERS THEN: A Different Perspective on Mental Health
Although past generations of teenagers did have their share of specific problems, the nature of those was very different from what youthful teens face today. Although they did struggle with issues like peer pressure, academic stress, and identity crises, they were not as likely to be exposed to the constant comparison and validation-seeking rampant on social media. In most instances, because disorders were highly stigmatized and poorly understood, mental health resources were limited. Besides, societal expectations and gender roles could place intense pressure on teenagers, young women in particular, into certain ways of conduct and behavior.</p>

<h1>New Fashion</h1>
<p>The 2000s was a fashion melting pot characterized by a blend of nostalgia, rebellion, and celebrity influence. The decade kicked off with remnants of the 90s, featuring low-rise jeans, oversized hoodies, and a casual, laid-back aesthetic. However, a significant shift occurred mid-decade with a resurgence of 60s and 80s fashion, marked by bohemian influences, denim miniskirts, and power shoulders. This eclectic mix coexisted with the rise of athleisure wear, as comfort became increasingly valued. Celebrity culture played a pivotal role in shaping trends, with pop stars and red carpet events dictating fashion choices for millions. Additionally, subcultures like emo, scene, and hip-hop emerged, offering alternative styles and challenging mainstream fashion norms. The 2000s was ultimately a decade of experimentation, where individuals could express their unique identities through a diverse range of fashion choices.</p>

<h1> New vs Old</h1>
<p>Fashion, a reflection of society's values, has undergone a dramatic evolution over time. In the past, clothing was primarily a functional necessity, dictated by climate, occupation, and social status. Garments were often handmade from natural materials and were designed for durability rather than aesthetics. Fashion trends were slower to spread, influenced by regional customs and economic factors. However, with the advent of industrialization and globalization, the fashion industry experienced a seismic shift. Mass production enabled the rapid dissemination of trends, transforming fashion into a global phenomenon. The rise of social media and e-commerce has further accelerated this process, making it easier than ever for consumers to access and adopt the latest styles. Today, fashion is no longer solely about utility; it serves as a form of self-expression, a way to connect with cultural movements, and a powerful economic force. While traditional craftsmanship and heritage brands still hold a significant place in the fashion landscape, contemporary designers are increasingly experimenting with innovative materials, sustainable practices, and inclusive designs. The blurred lines between high fashion and streetwear, the integration of technology into garments, and the growing emphasis on ethical and sustainable production are just a few examples of how fashion continues to evolve and adapt to the changing needs and desires of modern consumers.</p>
